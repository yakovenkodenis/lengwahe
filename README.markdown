#Introduction
Certainly,the world doesnt need another programming language, but I created one anyway just to learn how it is done. 
This is a Filipino programming language I created while reading a book. And im calling it LENGWAHE. How uninspiring is that?

#How it works
Basically all of the keywords uses "tagalog" words. The syntax is
similar to Ruby with Python indentation. A keyword "klase" means a
Class, a "paraan" as a Function, "kung" is "If", "kundi" as "if else"

Best way is to look at the sample


First lets define a class:

    klase Kahangahanga:
      paraan gumagana_ba 
        "oo naman!"

Then instantiate it:

    kahangahanga = Kahangahanga.bago

Then lets do some conditional statements:

    kung kahangahanga:
      imprenta("gumagana ba ang tagalog na lengwaheng ito?")
      imprenta(kahangahanga.gumagana_ba)`
    kundi:
      imprenta("parang may mali")

The output would be:

    // gumagana ba ang tagalog na lengwaheng ito?
    // oo naman!


The entire code is:

    klase Kahangahanga:
      paraan gumagana_ba 
        "oo naman!"

    kahangahanga = Kahangahanga.bago
    kung kahangahanga:`
      imprenta("gumagana ba ang tagalog na lengwaheng ito?")
      imprenta(kahangahanga.gumagana_ba)`
    kundi:
      imprenta("parang may mali")

    // gumagana ba ang tagalog na lengwaheng ito?
    // oo naman!

#Moving on
This is the end of my journey. So please dont expect new updates to this
language. Im going to use anything I learned from this to bigger things
I have in mind such as creating a JVM based javascript User Interface generator.This is a really fun experience, I hope you like it too. Enjoy!
